# Zamazenta

Experimental decompilation of Pokémon Sword/Shield for the Nintendo Switch.

## Approach

File, class and function names come from leftover information in the binaries and
educated guesses where no real name is given. This decompilation is completely
based on publicly available retail releases of Pokémon Sword/Shield and only focuses
on reflecting the game's inner workings. **In that sense, no assets or RomFS contents
which would be needed to produce a playable game will be included in this repository.**

I do not intend to do a perfect decompilation that produces identical binaries, but
rather to reflect the APIs of the game as accurately as possible without spending any
effort onto putting functions and data at the same addresses in memory.
